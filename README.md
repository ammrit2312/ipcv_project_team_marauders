# IPCV Project for Team Marauders

This repository contains the IPCV (UE19CS333) by Team Marauders.
This project is for Image Processing and Computer Vision Concepts.

### Title of the Project 

Hand Gesture Detection 

### Description of Project

Hand gesture recognition, which may be used to provide simple information via hand motions like OK, YES, NO, and other similar gestures, is the emphasis of the issue statement. Hand gestures can be used to engage with systems by people with impairments. Traditional interface technologies, such as the keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen, might limit our capacity to engage with the system. Physical touch is required to interact with each of these systems. Gestures can interpret the same functionality as interacting with the UI components physically.
